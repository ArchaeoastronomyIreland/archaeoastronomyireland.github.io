The passage tombs on Slieve Thoul are part of a wider complex of tombs on the summits of the hills and mountains of Dublin and Wicklow, with over twenty such monuments concentrated in this area.  The passage tombs on Slieve Thoul are the most north-westerly of this group of tombs. Tallaght Hill to the east and Seahan Mountain to the south-east are the closest tombs to Slieve Thoul.

The Ordnance Survey letters from the 1830s state that “…the two Cairns of Sliabh Toghail are open. The largest of them was very large and high and was opened within the last fifteen years. It contained a large grave, covered by a very large flag stone, which was broken and carried away, but the supports still remain, though not in their proper places”.
