                  This article presents an analysis of the astronomical function
                  of the Knowth passage tomb. Employing remote Geographic
                  Information System (GIS) methodology the true orientation of
                  the eastern passage has been determined with a high degree of
                  accuracy. The analysis reveals a line of symmetry in the
                  tomb's entrance stones that precisely aligns the eastern
                  passage with the Dowth passage tomb. This alignment, achieved
                  through a 40-meter passage, the longest in Western Europe,
                  demonstrates a remarkable level of engineering sophistication.
                  Unlike Newgrange's reliance on a separate lightbox, Knowth's
                  eastern passage was engineered as a single, precise
                  instrument. The findings conclude that the eastern passage of
                  Knowth was specifically designed to capture the first rays of
                  a celestial body rising from the Dowth mound on the horizon,
                  establishing a deliberate and highly sophisticated
                  astronomical relationship between the two monuments.

               <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed sans-serif mb-4">
                  The UNESCO World Heritage Site of Brú na Bóinne, or the
                  Archaeological Ensemble of the Bend of the Boyne, stands as
                  Ireland’s richest archaeological landscape, situated in a
                  meander of the River Boyne in County Meath. The site is
                  globally renowned for its spectacular prehistoric passage
                  tombs, which include the principal monuments of Newgrange,
                  Dowth, and Knowth. Constructed around 3200 BC during the
                  Neolithic period, these colossal structures are a testament to
                  the sophistication of their builders, predating the main
                  pyramids at Giza by approximately 400 years and the main
                  trilithon phase of Stonehenge by 500 to 700 years. The
                  monuments are not isolated features but are part of a larger
                  necropolis or cemetery that also includes henges, burial
                  mounds, and standing stones.

               </h4>
               <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed sans-serif mb-4">
                  While Newgrange often receives the most public attention,
                  Knowth is, in many respects, the most significant monument
                  within the Brú na Bóinne complex. It holds the distinction of
                  being the largest passage tomb, with a massive main mound
                  reaching about 12 meters in height and measuring between 67
                  and 95 meters in diameter, covering roughly 1 hectare (2.5
                  acres). Unlike Newgrange, which has a single passage, Knowth
                  is uniquely characterized by its two independent passages,
                  placed along an east-west line. A continuous ring of 127
                  kerbstones, of which 124 remain, encircles the base of the
                  great mound. The main mound is also surrounded by a series of
                  17 or 18 smaller satellite tombs, several of which are as
                  large as 20 meters in diameter and are believed to predate the
                  central cairn. The site's most remarkable feature, however, is
                  its unparalleled concentration of prehistoric art. Knowth is
                  home to the largest assemblage of megalithic art in Europe,
                  boasting over 400 engraved stones. This collection represents
                  more than a third of the total known examples of such art in
                  all of Western Europe, a fact that firmly establishes Knowth
                  as a global center of Neolithic artistic expression.

                  2.1. The Neolithic Foundation (c. 3200 BC)
               </h4>
               <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed sans-serif mb-4">
                  Knowth was built during the Neolithic or New Stone Age by a
                  wealthy farming community that thrived on the fertile lands of
                  the Boyne Valley. The construction of the central mound and
                  its surrounding satellite tombs demonstrates a high degree of
                  social organization and technical skill. Builders transported
                  local stones, or "pebbles," for the main cairn from nearby
                  river terraces , while sourcing larger structural slabs and
                  decorative stones from quarries as far as 50 kilometers away.
                  This was an enormous expenditure of labor and resources,
                  estimated to have taken at least 30 years to complete, which
                  points to a powerful belief in the hereafter and a cohesive,
                  purpose-driven society. The site’s initial function was that
                  of a passage tomb, a place of burial and ritual. The cremated
                  remains of the dead were placed on basin stones within the
                  chambers. The relatively small number of individuals buried
                  here suggests that the monument’s value was more ceremonial
                  than strictly funerary, serving as an important cultural and
                  spiritual center for the community. Evidence from radiocarbon
                  dating indicates that the burial activity at Knowth may have
                  been concentrated in a "short burst" between 3200 and 2900 BC,
                  rather than serving as an ossuary for successive generations.
                  Interestingly, archaeological findings reveal that some of the
                  satellite mounds predate the colossal central cairn,
                  indicating a multi-phase construction process over a period of
                  at least three centuries.

               </h4>
               <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed sans-serif mb-4">
                  The landscape of Brú na Bóinne is deeply embedded in Irish
                  mythology, and Knowth is no exception. In ancient Irish
                  folklore, Knowth is known as Cnoc Buí, the Hill of Buí. Buí
                  was the sovereignty goddess and consort of Lugh of the Long
                  Arm, a prominent figure in the Irish pantheon. Mythological
                  accounts state that she was buried within the great mound, and
                  the pair of standing stones at the western entrance may
                  symbolically represent Lugh and Buí.A prevailing mythological
                  interpretation suggests that each of the three great mounds in
                  the Boyne Valley holds a symbolic role in a life cycle:
                  Newgrange represents Birth, Knowth represents Marriage, and
                  Dowth represents Death. This symbolic journey from one mound
                  to the next represents a ritualistic path into the underworld
                  and a safe return, emphasizing the passage tombs as conduits
                  between the living and the dead. Knowth’s dual passages may be
                  a physical manifestation of this symbolic role, representing a
                  union or coming together, akin to a marriage, a place of
                  connection and convergence. Other traditions associate the
                  "cave of Cnogba" with being an entrance to the Otherworld.

                  2.3. The Post-Neolithic
               </h4>
               <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed sans-serif mb-4">
                  The history of Knowth extends far beyond its initial purpose
                  as a Neolithic tomb, offering a rare glimpse into the
                  continuous cultural re-appropriation of a single site over
                  millennia. After its primary period of use, the mound
                  gradually fell into disrepair, but the area remained a focal
                  point for ritual activity during the Bronze Age, as evidenced
                  by a grooved ware timber circle and a large number of votive
                  offerings found near the eastern passage entrance.In the late
                  Iron Age and early Christian period, around the time of
                  Christ, the site was transformed into a hill fort and became a
                  habitation site for the first time. Two large ditches were dug
                  around the mound, and souterrains were added. It was at this
                  time that the ancient passages seem to have been rediscovered,
                  with early Christian graffiti and four names carved in ogham
                  script on the stones of the eastern chamber, forging a direct
                  physical link between the old and new inhabitants. Knowth rose
                  to political prominence as the capital of the Kingdom of
                  Northern Brega. Archaeological findings from this period are
                  remarkably rich, with material from the tenth to thirteenth
                  centuries comparable to what has been recovered from
                  Viking-era Dublin, suggesting a vibrant period of trade and
                  influence.The site’s strategic importance continued, albeit
                  briefly, into the Norman period, when it was used as a motte
                  in the twelfth century. Following the Norman invasion, the
                  site passed into the hands of the Cistercian monks of
                  Mellifont Abbey, who used it as a grange or farm, building
                  stone walls and structures on top of the ancient mound. This
                  agricultural use continued until 1939, when the site was
                  acquired by the state, marking the beginning of its modern
                  role as a national monument and a subject of scientific
                  inquiry. The continuous occupation and transformation of the
                  site from a sacred burial ground to a royal seat and then a
                  farm illustrate its enduring cultural and strategic
                  significance to successive generations.

               </h4>
               <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed sans-serif mb-4">
                  The modern history of Knowth begins with its first scholarly
                  mention by Sir Thomas Molyneux around 1713. However, the early
                  approach to such sites was often driven by curiosity rather
                  than rigorous methodology. This is exemplified by the
                  "unprofessional excavation" at the nearby Dowth mound in 1847,
                  which severely damaged the monument. A more systematic, but
                  still limited, investigation was carried out by R. A. S.
                  Macalister in 1941. He dug a trench in an attempt to find the
                  entrance to the mound and, in the process, exposed 58
                  kerbstones, 48 of which were engraved. Macallister’s work,
                  while not a full-scale excavation, was the first to document
                  the monument's extensive artistic legacy.

               </h4>
               <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed sans-serif mb-4">
                  The systematic and thorough archaeological investigation of
                  Knowth began in 1962, led by Professor George Eogan of
                  University College Dublin. Eogan, who had previously worked on
                  a passage tomb at Fourknocks, was tasked with investigating
                  the potential of the Knowth site. His decades-long project,
                  which lasted over 40 years, became a foundational model for
                  modern archaeological inquiry, shifting the focus from
                  spectacular finds to a comprehensive understanding of a site's
                  entire history.The excavations yielded several dramatic
                  breakthroughs. In 1967, Eogan’s team discovered a small hole
                  on the western side of the mound that led to a chamber at the
                  end of a 34-meter passage. A year later, on August 1, 1968, an
                  even more significant discovery was made: the eastern passage
                  and its chamber. Eogan himself recounted the excitement of
                  crawling into the void with a flashlight, revealing the
                  impressive, well-constructed chamber that was over 20 feet
                  high. These discoveries revealed that Knowth was not only the
                  largest passage tomb in the Brú na Bóinne complex but also
                  uniquely contained two independent passages.Beyond the
                  passages, Eogan’s team uncovered 18 smaller satellite tombs,
                  revealing the full extent of the complex. The excavations also
                  yielded a wealth of artifacts, including a beautifully
                  engraved flint macehead found in the eastern tomb in 1982.
                  This ceremonial object is considered one of the finest works
                  of art to have survived from Neolithic Europe. Eogan's
                  meticulous, multi-volume publications on the site have
                  transformed our understanding of Knowth from a mere mound into
                  a "multi-period and multi-cultural site" with a rich and
                  complex chronological sequence.

                     The Knowth complex is an imposing and intricate
                     archaeological landscape. The centerpiece is the great
                     mound, a massive structure about 12 meters high and 67 to
                     95 meters in diameter, which covers an acre of ground. The
                     main cairn is surrounded by a ring of 17 or 18 smaller
                     satellite mounds. Most of these smaller mounds are also
                     passage tombs, and some are as large as 20 meters in
                     diameter, with archaeological evidence suggesting they
                     predate the main mound. A reconstruction of a grooved ware
                     timber circle stands near the entrance to the eastern
                     passage, providing a visual representation of the site’s

                  The eastern passage is a marvel of Neolithic engineering and
                  is the longest megalithic passage in Western Europe,
                  stretching 40 meters. It culminates in a cruciform chamber, a
                  layout similar to the chamber at Newgrange, with a central
                  space and three side recesses. The chamber is topped by a
                  corbelled roof, a series of overlapping stones that form a
                  high, conical vault, which has remained intact for over 5,000
                  years.This chamber yielded some of the most spectacular
                  artifacts found at Knowth. A large basin stone, often referred
                  to as the "Dagdas cauldron" was found in the right-hand
                  recess. One of the most significant finds was a ceremonial
                  macehead, recovered from beneath the chamber in 1982. Carved
                  from a hard, creamy-grey flint, this small object is
                  exquisitely decorated on each of its six sides with spirals,
                  whorls, and diamond patterns. Some researchers suggest the
                  designs and shape of the macehead are meant to represent a
                  human face, with the shaft hole serving as the mouth. This
                  object is considered one of the finest works of art from
                  Neolithic Europe and is now displayed at the National Museum
                  of Ireland.

                  Located on the opposite side of the mound, the western passage
                  is 34 meters in length. It leads to an "undifferentiated"
                  chamber, meaning the passage simply widens to form the burial
                  chamber, without the distinct cruciform shape of the eastern
                  tomb. A basin stone was also present in this chamber, but at
                  some point in the monument's later history, an attempt was
                  made to remove it. The stone became stuck in the passage
                  because it was wider than the space itself, where it remains
                  to this day. The western passage also contained a small stone
                  phallus, another artifact that provides a glimpse into the
                  ritualistic life of the Neolithic builders.

                     Knowth's most celebrated feature is its vast collection of
                     megalithic art, which represents the largest assemblage of
                     its kind in Western Europe. A total of 261 stones are
                     decorated, accounting for approximately 45% of all engraved
                     megalithic stones in Ireland. A continuous ring of 127
                     kerbstones encircles the base of the mound, and of the 124
                     that survive, a remarkable 90 are engraved with intricate
                     patterns.The art is primarily abstract and geometrical,
                     created using chisels and punch tools.

                     Common motifs include spirals, lozenges, zigzags,
                     concentric circles, and serpentine forms. However, Knowth’s
                     art also includes unique images, such as crescent shapes
                     and what is considered to be the oldest known illustration
                     of the moon in history.A significant portion of this
                     artwork is of a type known as "hidden art," where carvings
                     were placed on the backs of stones that would be concealed
                     within the mound.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed sans-serif mb-4">
                  The intentional concealment of this art has led to several
                  theories about its purpose. One hypothesis is that the art was
                  not intended for public viewing but had a private or
                  structural ritualistic purpose. An alternative theory suggests
                  that the builders simply recycled stones from an older
                  monument, reusing the uncarved side for the new construction.
                  This practice of using stones sourced from distant quarries, a
                  common feature of Brú na Bóinne monuments, supports the idea
                  that material was carefully selected and perhaps even
                  repurposed.The architectural differences and the distinct
                  nature of the artifacts found in the two passages suggest that
                  they may have served different functions. The elaborate,
                  cruciform eastern chamber, with its spectacular macehead and
                  basin, appears to have been the primary ceremonial space. The
                  western passage, with its simpler design and the displaced
                  basin stone, may have had a different, perhaps less revered,
                  role. These nuances highlight the complexity of Knowth's
                  design, suggesting that its purpose was not monolithic but
                  rather a dynamic, multi-functional sacred space.

                     Knowth's astronomical purpose has been a subject of intense
                     academic debate, and its story stands in stark contrast to
                     the well-known and widely accepted solar alignment of
                     Newgrange. The long-held initial theory, popularized by
                     researchers such as Martin Brennan and George Eogan,
                     proposed that Knowth's two passages were aligned with the
                     sunrise and sunset of the spring and autumn equinoxes.

               </div>
               <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed sans-serif mb-4">
                  This theory was based on the east-west orientation of the
                  passages and the symbolic importance of the equinoxes, which
                  would have marked the beginning of the growing season and the
                  time of harvest for the Neolithic farming community.However,
                  this theory has been largely debunked by modern research. The
                  entrances to the passages were altered by later settlers,
                  making a precise alignment impossible to verify today.
                  Furthermore, the passages themselves are not aligned to a
                  precise east-west axis, but rather at an angle that would have
                  captured light several days before or after the equinox.

                     The prevailing hypothesis now suggests that Knowth’s
                     primary astronomical function was lunar. The evidence
                     supporting this theory is limited but compelling and
                     suggests a more profound understanding of celestial
                     mechanics than previously assumed. Lunar hypothesis are
                     largely based on the kerbstone artwork. Supposed key pieces
                     of evidence for the lunar theory include Orthostat 47, a
                     carving on a vertical stone at the end of the eastern
                     passage, has been 'identified' by planetary cartographer
                     Philip J. Stooke as a map of the lunar maria, or "seas".

                  This proposed detailed depiction of the moon's surface as seen
                  with the naked eye and is considered the by some as the oldest
                  known lunar map in history. The Kerbstones: The vast majority
                  of the carved stones at Knowth are believed to bear lunar
                  symbols and calculations. Kerbstone 5, for instance, has been
                  interpreted as a depiction of the phases of a total solar
                  eclipse, an event that is predictable only with a
                  sophisticated understanding of the lunar cycle. Kerbstone 30
                  features "Opposed Cs," which may represent the first and last
                  days of the lunar month. The presence of 18 satellite mounds
                  surrounding the main cairn has been linked to the 18.6-year
                  lunar cycle, a complex celestial pattern that would have
                  required meticulous, long-term observation to track. This
                  shift in scholarly opinion from a simple solar alignment to a
                  complex lunar hypothesis would require a profound intellectual
                  sophistication of the Neolithic people. The solar cycle is a
                  predictable, 365-day rhythm, but the lunar cycle is far more
                  complex to track and requires a much higher level of
                  astronomical knowledge to predict events like eclipses. The
                  juxtaposition of a solar-aligned monument (Newgrange) with a
                  potential lunar-focused one (Knowth) suggests that the Brú na
                  Bóinne complex was not a series of similar tombs but a
                  holistic astronomical observatory, a dual calendar system for
                  tracking both the solar year and the lunar month and lunar
                  cycles. These theories elevate the Neolithic builders from
                  mere sun-worshippers to advanced scientists who were capable
                  of mapping and predicting the most complex celestial movements
                  visible to the naked eye.

                  To make any definitive observations or claims in the field of
                  archaeoastronomy, there is a reliance on accurate and precise
                  data. Central to this is the correct measurement of a
                  feature's orientation or azimuth. For the monuments of Brú na
                  Bóinne, a foundational body of data comes from the work of
                  M.J. O'Kelly, George Eogan and their respective teams.
                  However, all plans for all of the three main passage tombs
                  have been found to contain inaccuracies. Where these plans are
                  perfectly suitable for understanding the physical layout and
                  form of the tomb, these issues render the plans totally
                  unsuitable for astronomical analysis. A direct result of the
                  incorrect orientation of the Knowth passages led to the
                  proposed (and incorrect) hypothesis of alignment on the
                  equinox rise and set. In 'The megalithic art of the passage
                  tombs at Knowth' version 7, these issues are explained and
                  more importantly corrected!

                  An examination of specific architectural and design elements
                  common to both the Newgrange and Knowth passage tombs suggests

                  Using the overhead plan for newgrange we can draw a line of
                  symmetry between these vertically grooved stones. This line
                  describes the tomb's longest axis. The line intersects key
                  architectural and design features. The line intersects the
                  chamber triple spiral motif, passes directly through the
                  passage, next bisecting the decorated panels of the roofbox.
                  This line precisely marks the orientation of the tomb on the

                  The entrance stones to the Knowth passages are analogous with
                  the Newgrange vertically grooved stones. Completing the same
                  exercise with the vertically grooved entrance stones for
                  Knowth we can make the following observations. Working from
                  west to east, the line of symmetry exactly intersects the
                  southmost corner of the undifferentiated chamber of Knowth's
                  western passage. It next exactly bisects the rear stone of the
                  recess of the eastern chamber (Orthostat 47), before exactly
                  defining the centerline of the eastern passage. Here again we
                  must conclude that this has been planned and executed with the
                  same significant surveying skills in evidence. We also might
                  assess that the pre-eminent orientation of Knowth is that of
                  the eastern passage, as the line of symmetry is directed along
                  this azimuth.

                  Completing an in in situ analsysis of the Dowth passage tomb
                  would be a extremely difficult if not impossible task. The
                  view from the eastern passage is significantly restricted,
                  hindering any astronomical or topographical analysis. This
                  obstruction is due to several key factors:
                  <br /><br />
                  Damage and Alterations:
                  <br />
                  The entrance to the eastern passage has suffered considerable
                  damage over time and has been altered from its original state.
                  These changes have likely compromised the passage's initial
                  sightlines.
                  <br /><br />
                  Modern Infrastructure:
                  <br />
                  The introduction of modern infrastructure, specifically
                  designed to facilitate public access, has inadvertently
                  created new obstructions. Features such as walkways, railings,
                  and other structural additions block the natural view from
                  within the passage.
                  <br /><br />
                  Environmental Obstructions:
                  <br />
                  The surrounding environment further compounds the issue.
                  Nearby trees and buildings completely obscure any view toward
                  the horizon, making it impossible to observe celestial events
                  from this specific vantage point.

                  Our initial task is to georeference the Knowth plan and
                  overlay it onto a modern map. This remote process provides a
                  significant advantage by offering a clear overhead view of the
                  internal passages while simultaneously placing them within
                  their broader, surrounding environment. This allows for a
                  comprehensive analysis of the site’s layout and its
                  relationship to the surrounding landscape, which is essential
                  for understanding the builders’ intent. Using GIS mapping and
                  azimuth measurement tools, we can also, with extreme accuracy,
                  recreate the tomb's line of symmetry. This analysis reveals an
                  angle of 84° (83.8° in the WGS 84 coordinate system)

                  To overcome the issues of an obstructed view, we can create a
                  viewshed horizon for the site. This is a 360-degree
                  calculation of all visible horizon points. For this analysis,
                  we used a digital terrain model (DTM) that combines
                  high-resolution LiDAR data for local horizons with 1
                  arc-second SRTM data for more distant ones. A Digital Terrain
                  Model (DTM) is a digital representation of a bare-earth
                  surface. It has been processed to remove all features above
                  the ground, such as trees and buildings. Using a DTM in our
                  analysis allows us to accurately calculate a viewshed horizon
                  as we suspect it would have appeared in prehistory, before
                  these modern obstructions were present. The viewshed horizon,
                  indicated by the blue line in the image, reveals a significant
                  observation: the Dowth passage tomb mound is clearly visible
                  on the horizon in a generally easterly direction. This
                  immediate and easily recognized observation highlights the
                  intervisibility between these two major passage tombs, which
                  is crucial for understanding the broader prehistoric landscape
                  and the intentional placement of these monuments.

                  Based on the analysis, we can make a key observation: the
                  direction toward the Dowth passage tomb appears to be
                  generally consistent with the line of symmetry of Knowth's
                  eastern passage. To confirm this, we extend the original line
                  of symmetry directly out to the horizon. In the accompanying
                  image, this line has not been angle-adjusted in any way, it
                  has simply been extended. Our analysis shows that this line of
                  symmetry is exactly directed at the center point of the Dowth
                  passage tomb mound. In other words, the eastern passage of
                  Knowth is precisely directed at the Dowth passage tomb on the
                  horizon, suggesting a deliberate and precise relationship
                  between the two monumental sites.

                  The next task is to determine if it was possible for any light
                  to penetrate the eastern passage and reach the chamber's rear
                  recess. For this analysis, the side-view plan of the eastern
                  passage is used to measure all possible angles where light
                  could enter. This plan is crucial for examining the tomb's
                  internal geometry and the vertical alignment of its roof,
                  floor, and entrance stone. A consideration in this analysis is
                  a likely displaced passage capstone near the entrance.
                  However, by measuring all possible entry angles, a definite
                  'window of opportunity' for light to enter the passage was
                  determined. This window is a narrow range of elevations,
                  specifically between approximately 0.75° and 1.0° above the
                  horizon. This finding is significant because it suggests the
                  builders deliberately designed the passage to allow light to
                  enter only under very specific conditions.

                  While there is evident disturbance to the orthostats close to
                  the passage entrance, where we examine the passage in the
                  horizontal plane, a direct light path is nevertheless
                  available. By analyzing the angles from an overhead
                  perspective, it was determined that this path constitutes a
                  narrow opening of approximately 0.4° in width.

                  Having determined that light entry within the eastern passage
                  has been possible, the analysis now moves to a
                  three-dimensional model of the landscape. By creating a
                  modeled landscape for the Knowth location using LiDAR and SRTM
                  data, the precise view to the horizon can be shown. Importing
                  this modelled landscape into astronomy software allows us to
                  introduce the fourth dimension of time.
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  Using a neolithic timeframe:
				  <br>
				  <strong>Dowth Eastern Passage Sun rise @ 83.8° 8 days before/after equinox.</strong><br>
				  <strong>Dowth Western Passage Sun set @ 258° 17/18 days before/after equinox (sun rising at 103°).</strong>
				  <br>
				  <br>These azimuth values do not demonstrate any correlation with any known solar/lunar patterns beyond predictable specific solar rises and sets. Moon rises and sets (including full moon rises/sets) are certainly demonstrable, but are they predicatable ?

				  Using the modelled landscape typical sun or moon rises out of the Dowth mound can be demonstrated. A suggested
                  lightbox based on the analysis of the site plans can also be
                  indicated. The only light that could ever penetrate through to
                  the rear recess of the eastern passage of Knowth would have
                  been the very first rays of the sun, the moon, or a planet
                  rising from the Dowth passage tomb on the horizon.

				  <strong>Hypothesised Lighting Effect.</strong><br>
				  
				  <br>
                     Based on the visual experience of light entry at Newgrange
                     we can suggest the likely lighting effect within the Knowth
                     eastern passage chamber. As first light enters it will
                     immediately strike the center of the end recess back stone
                     (Orthostat 47). The light beam will quickly move downwards
                     forming a spear of light which then progressively exits the
                     chamber.

				  The examination of the Dowth passage tomb has been demonstrated that passage tombs have been present directly in front of both the north and south passages. Here we have demonstrated the Dowth passage tomb to be directly in front of Knowths eastern passage. It is worth noting that Knowth passage tomb Site 7 (ME019-030007-) is located some 160 meters to the southwest, directly in front of the western passage.

                     This analysis of the eastern passage of Knowth leads to a
                     definitive conclusion: it was specifically designed to
                     capture light from a celestial body rising out of the Dowth
                     passage tomb on the horizon. The passage itself, at 40
                     meters, is a testament to the builders' advanced skills,
                     creating an incredibly narrow horizontal and vertical
                     window for light. Unlike the Newgrange passage tomb which
                     relies on a separate lightbox, Knowth's builders engineered
                     the passage to be the sole instrument for this precise
                     alignment. The combined evidence leaves no doubt that the
                     eastern passage of Knowth was not merely a tomb, but a
                     sophisticated astronomical instrument.
